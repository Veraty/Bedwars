# Bedwars

Gameplay
-
Bedwars is played in the sky. A regular map will have a middle,bases and often islands/platforms inbetween.
The goal of the game is to destroy the beds of other teams and to eliminate the opponents.
Once your bed is destroyed you are'nt able to respawn as a player again.
The last team standing will win the round.
Different kinds of items are spawning in different periods all over the map.
One will find a "Shop" on every base that is used to buy stuff from items.
Expensive Items will most likely be at the middle of a map. So every team that wonts those items
has to go to the middle.
